# WhatsApp Clone - React Native & Redux

A fully functional **WhatsApp clone** developed using **React Native** and **Redux** for state management. This app replicates the core features of WhatsApp, allowing users to chat, search for contacts, create groups, and update their profiles. Designed with a focus on performance and user experience, this project demonstrates my expertise in mobile app development and state management.

## Key Features
1. **Real-Time Chat**:
   - Send and receive messages in real-time.
   - Support for text messages, emojis, and media (images, videos, etc.).
   - Read receipts and typing indicators.

2. **Search Functionality**:
   - Search for contacts and chat history quickly and efficiently.

3. **Group Chats**:

   - Add or remove participants.
   - Group-specific settings and notifications.

4. **User Profiles**:
   - Update profile information (name, profile picture, status, etc.).
   - Secure authentication and authorization.

5. **State Management with Redux**:
   - Centralized state management for seamless data flow.
   - Efficient handling of user data, messages, and app state.

6. **Responsive UI**:
   - Clean and intuitive user interface.
   - Optimized for both iOS and Android platforms.

## Technologies Used
- **React Native**: For cross-platform mobile app development.
- **Redux**: For state management and data flow.
- **React Navigation**: For seamless navigation between screens.
- **Expo**: For development and testing.

## Challenges & Learnings
